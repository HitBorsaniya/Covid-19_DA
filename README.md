# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis Dashboard - Power BI Project

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project analyzing the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project demonstrates how data visualization and storytelling can be used to gain insights into complex global data.

## 📊 Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic created an enormous amount of data related to infection rates, deaths, recoveries, and testing across countries and over time. This project analyzes that data using Microsoft Power BI to help users:

- Track global and country-specific trends
- Identify critical KPIs such as fatality rate and recovery rate
- Compare countries based on various health metrics
- Explore daily, weekly, and monthly trends

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and transform raw COVID-19 data
- Create dynamic and interactive Power BI visualizations
- Use DAX to calculate meaningful metrics and KPIs
- Design an intuitive dashboard for easy exploration and decision-making
